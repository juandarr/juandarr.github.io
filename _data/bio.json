    "summary": "Welcome to my home page. I am a passionate engineer with drive to solve problems in the world by means of engineering, science, entrepreneurship and coding. My range of exploration has gone from magnetic levitation systems, eolic energy generators, drones for aerial photography to robots for surveillance in closed spaces and medical assistance of the elderly, a smart water meter and a musical device to create music from motion and spatial gestures. This journey has taught me what it takes to create models, simulations, physical devices and cloud computing platforms by combining skills and tools from converging disciplines such as mathematics, physical modeling, software, hardware and design.",
