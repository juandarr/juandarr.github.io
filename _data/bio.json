    "summary": "Welcome to my home page. I am a passionate engineer with drive to solve problems in the world by means of engineering, science, entrepreneurship and coding. My range of exploration has gone from magnetic levitation systems, eolic energy generators, drones for aerial photography to robots for surveillance in closed spaces and medical assistance of the elderly, a smart water meter and a musical device to create music from motion and spatial gestures. This experiences have taught me what is needed to create models, physical devices and software by facilitating the convergence of disciplines such as mathematics, physical modeling, software, hardware and design. If you are interested in my work, please check my portfolio and blog sections. ",
