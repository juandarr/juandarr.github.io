We are in a time where things are changing quite fast. I doesn't a go a week without groundbreaking or at least remarkable new results showcasing the new capabilities of sequence token models in the world of text, image, voice and video. Some of those results are useful and potetially disruptive. Others are presented as the next big thing without any proof or glimpse of its real implication or utility.
Recently, I found a new technique used to recreate the hand writing style given a set of samples. The author used this technique to recreate the handwriting of his deceased father, the one person who used to work with him on new projects and whom he totally misses. His project was inspired and guided by a guy on the internet who presented this technique on Reddit, and show the following sample recreating the hand writting of J.K.K, the late author of Lord of The Rings:

Ethical implications aside I think this project is neat. Having something that resembles the memory of a person dear to us is meaninful and valuable. The method is based on the new generation of image models relase by FLUX, a new company branched from the pioneer company which released some of the first and most notable open source diffusion models, stability AI. I will be digging more on this topic on the following days. My goal is to recreate the hand writting of my father. He died several months ago and I miss him very much. It turns out his hand writting was one the things I admired the most about him. He was an artist in his own right, being able to draw, sing and playing the guitar.
