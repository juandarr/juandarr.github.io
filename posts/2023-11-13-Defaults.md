Inspired by the current trend of posting the default apps in your digital life I decide to post my own. I was initially made aware of the trend by [Kev Quirk's post](https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023), one of the admins of Fosstodon, the corner of the web where I have lived for a while. 
I also read the whole list of default by different people collected in the wholesome list by Robb Knight: [Default apps](https://defaults.rknight.me). On mobile I mainly use an Android phone, and also have an iPad which I mostly use for YouTube, checking social media (Twitter, Mastodon) and to read. On desktop I am Linux user, but currently using Windows 11 with WSL2.
