# WattDepot

WattDepot is an open source, RESTful web service that collects electricity data (such as current power utilization or cumulative power utilization) from meters and stores it in a database. The data can then be retrieved by other tools for visualization and analysis. It is designed to provide infrastructure for experimentation and development of “Smart Grid” applications.

Selected publications:

* Robert Brewer and Philip Johnson, WattDepot: An open source software ecosystem for enterprise-scale energy data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization, In Proceedings of the First International Conference on Smart Grid Communications, October, 2010, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
