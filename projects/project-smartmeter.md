<p class="pjustify">I was part of the foundational team of a startup located in the Cambridge Innovation Center. Leaded the conception, design and development of a smart water meter, vale and hub as a solution for business to control and monitor the water consumptions in their facilities. Working from the perspectiva of hardware and firmware development I took the project from prototype to manufacturing (pilot tests) phase in a period of time of about one and a half years. The data was collected in the cloud using AWS and mongoDB. A webapp was designed with meteor to work in pair with the hardware for analytics, management and visualization of water consumption and device status.</p>

<p class="pjustify">Also, as a member of the Cambridge innovation center I was exposed and actively involved to Bostonâ€™s startup ecosystem, learning best practices and tools to thrive in an entrepreneurial and highly demanding environment.</p>
