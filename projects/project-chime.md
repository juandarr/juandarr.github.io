summary: I designed and built a musical device to create music from motion and spatial gestures. The device takes inputs from different physical variables from the environment via an accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, temperature and humidity sensor. This inputs are taken in consideration to generate music procedurally according to variations in the sensed values.

Vacay is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 415, Spring 2015. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
