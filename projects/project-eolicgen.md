summary: I designed and built an eolic energy generator. Faraday induction is used here to transform kinetic of a rotor energy into electric energy. The convertion process starts when wind power pushes an arrangement of 2 propellers whose inclination can be change by means of a gear mechanism. The propellers transform this eolic energy in mechanical rotation for a straigh axis where a set of 4 magnets are attached. Relative motion between the set of magnets and two coils generates electricity.

The goal of this project was to design and build a device able to convert mechanical energy obtained from the air flow into eletrical energy. In this project I learned basic concepts about mechanism design and applied it in conjuntion with physics and engineering concepts. Faraday induction explains the physical phenomenon behind energy generation: electrical energy can be obtained aplying the Faraday's law in which the induced electromotive force (EMF or electric potential) in any closed circuit is equal to the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit.

A flux of air enters through a semiclosed cilindrical cavity, and according to its force and the wings' inclination, the rotor moves along with four magnets. The relative movement between these magnets and the coil generates an induced electromotive force which moves the electrons of the metallic material and then, produces an electrical current (electrical energy generation). A video that exemplify the mechanical movement of the system, and the idea behind this project is shown next:
