# Morea Framework

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/morea-framework.png">

The Morea Framework provides a new way to generate educational websites organized by Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments.

Morea implements a simple pedagogical pattern: a course is a sequence of modules, each with one or more learning outcomes. Modules can combine one or more passive readings (providing background) with one or more active experiences (in-class work or homework). Finally, a module can contain one or more assessments to help students determine if theyâ€™ve achieved the learning outcomes.

Our experience shows that students and teachers both benefit by making this course design explicit. For example, Morea generates course websites that organize course content in multiple ways: by modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments. This makes it easier for teachers to design well structured courses, and easier for students to understand what they need to learn and how to learn it.
