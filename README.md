## TODO 

- [ ] Define a color palette and stick to it.
- [ ] Improve description of each project. Text in card should be brief, then explanations must be created from an experienced engineer POV. 
- [ ] JD logo.
- [ ] Improve description of project in projects page. They should be short and concise.
- [ ] Improve style of blog page. Consider a better look for the essay card and then the content.
