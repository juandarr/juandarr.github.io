After several weeks of internal deliberation I decided to add RSS to the blog section of my personal website. I have been using RSS for years as a way to quickly glance and filter the news relevant to me from different sources. It is quite useful to save time, since you generally have access to the tittle and a short description of the article, giving you enough information to decide whether is worth to read, listen to or explore. 

## My motivation
Bringing RSS as a tool to communicate with the world is also a way to free myself from the dependency on algorithms and systems deciding what is important to me, given by the arbitrary collection of data used to profile my interests and personality. I am done with such practice. I really think the human experience should not be left to the cold data manipulation of machines. The intricacies of who we are, what we love/enjoy, why we live, how we spend our time and other relevant aspects of being human are too important to let machines and worse, corporations (with its unilateral and cold profit motive) decide over what, when, how and why something should be placed on my mind. 

## How did I do it?
For my personal blog I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a framework that renders markdown and produces a complete, static website ready to be several  by Apache, Nginx or other web server. Here are the steps I took while adding this feature to my Jekyll blog:

### 1) Add site detail to your Jekyll config file
Add the key/value pairs to your `_config.yml` as follows:

```yml
name: Your blog's name
description: description of your blog
url: https://example.com
```

### 2) Add `feed.xml` to the root
The Jekyll community has created several ways to include RSS in a blog. In my case I created  a `feed.xml` file at the root of the main folder using the generic template (`feed.xml`) included in the Github repository [jekyll-rss-feeds](https://github.com/georgemandis/jekyll-rss-feeds) by George Mandis.

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0"
xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
xmlns:sy="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/">
<channel>
<title>{{ site.name | xml_escape }}</title>
<description>{% if site.description %}{{ site.description | xml_escape }}{% endif %}</description>
<sy:updatePeriod>{{ site.feed_update_period | default: "daily" | xml_escape }}</sy:updatePeriod>
<sy:updateFrequency>{{ site.feed_update_frequency | default: 1 | xml_escape }}</sy:updateFrequency>
<link>{{ site.url }}</link>
<atom:link href="{{ site.url }}/{{ page.path }}" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" />
<lastBuildDate>{% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{{ post.date | date_to_rfc822 }}{% endfor %}</lastBuildDate>
{% assign feed_items = site.feed_items | default: 10 %}
{% for post in site.posts limit:feed_items %}
<item>
<title>{{ post.title | xml_escape }}</title>
{% if post.author.name %}
<dc:creator>{{ post.author.name | xml_escape }}</dc:creator>
{% endif %}
{% if post.excerpt %}
<description>{{ post.excerpt | xml_escape }}</description>
{% else %}
<description>{{ post.content | xml_escape }}</description>
{% endif %}
<pubDate>{{ post.date | date_to_rfc822 }}</pubDate>
<link>{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}</guid>
</item>
{% endfor %}
</channel>
</rss>
```

### 3) Build your site and push
Finally, just `jekyll build` your site and push. If you are in Github pages, push your changes to master and your new RSS will be ready as soon as the changes are updated in Github. 

It is also a good idea to add a `<link>` element in the document `<head>` for browsers that have built in support for RSS feed-readers. A line like the following one should work: 

```html
<link href="/blog/feed.xml" type="application/rss+xml" rel="alternate" title="Latest 10 blog posts (atom)" />
```


## Final impressions
I am quite happy with the results. Right now I am uploading this brief article as a post. My commitment is to write my experiences while exploring the world of computers, programming and the open web as often as possible.
