During the last week I have been reviewing concepts from the world wide web. HTML was my first topic, then I move to CSS. They are really delightful topics and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I wanted to learn how to build web pages since I was basically a young teenager (14 years old) and now I am basically reliving that dream, but with the autonomy of time and attention direction as well as more abundant resources to do what I want. Here I will describe a short exploration I have done in the world of static website generator, which are programs that allow to generate static websites (mostly based on HTML and CSS) that don't require a web server or a database. 

## Jekyll

## Hugo
